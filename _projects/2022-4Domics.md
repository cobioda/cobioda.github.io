New technological advances are revolutionizing biology at all scales and result in the production of massive complex data that are heterogeneous and often highly-dimensional. They open new perspectives in deciphering complex biological processes that are dynamic (e.g. development, evolution), multi-varied (e.g. molecules, physicochemical parameters) and multi-scale (from molecules to ecosystems, from milliseconds to millions of years). Meeting big challenges of tomorrow's biology requires to combine reductive and integrative methods, and to focus on key elements that make up the system in order to explore the most relevant interactions. This is not only a matter of biological experiments, but also of proper data processing and management, at a real interface between biology and data science. This is the collective ambition of our two research-intensive universities (Université Côte d’Azur, UCA; Aix Marseille Université, AMU) and of their two care institution partners (Marseille University Hospital, APHM; Institut Paoli Calmette, IPC) to set up a coherent regional digital resource able to boost our biological research programs.

4D-omics is aimed at structuring the biological component of Data Center Sud, the newly established regional data center organized within the administrative Sud region (Marseille to Nice geographical area). 4D-omics will gather the necessary equipment and resources to perform high-impact programs that necessitate massive data storage and high-performance calculation. The resulting infrastructure will store biological data, will model relevant living organisms and will integrate the impacts of molecular and subcellular changes in normal or pathological biological systems. We will address data throughout its entire life cycle, from acquisition and storage, to processing, and analysis, including a compatibility for re-analysis, thus following all requirements for FAIR open data science. As such, our approach will also support the notion of data diffusion throughout the scientific community. Considering the relative unpredictability of scientific breakthroughs, the infrastructure will be built on a broad basis, able to support a large variety of high-impact projects. Our scientific project will decipher at different scales the fundamental mechanisms that drive living organisms (from molecules to organisms considered in their complex environment), in order to better understand biological, adaptive and physiological functions, as well as pathological situations.

4D-omics puts together very active local research communities in biology and data science, all working in leading institutions and laboratories. They collectively represent the second largest scientific cluster in France, distinguished by many memberships to the French Academy of Sciences, three Gold Medals of CNRS, and 4 Grand Prix Inserm. Our region has also a longstanding recognition in artificial intelligence (AI), as illustrated by the birth of the Prolog language in Colmerauer’s group (Marseille, 1972) and by the importance of the Sophia Antipolis technological park in the field of information technologies. The regional activity is maintained by a vibrant community of internationally-recognized experts in omics, evolution, imaging, machine-learning theory, and deep learning models. This dynamism is well illustrated by the creation in 2019 in Nice-Sophia Antipolis of one of the four French "Interdisciplinary Institutes of Artificial Intelligence", with Computational Biology as one major research axes, and in Marseille of the Archimede Institute, which develops similar aims.

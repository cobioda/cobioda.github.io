This project aims to bring together a network of bioinformaticians to support the Université Côte d'Azur research teams. The IdeX Academy 4 grants a position for a research engineer in application development for a period of one year, who will be in charge of the implementation and deployement of a web portal for managing bioinformatics analyses. This tool should make accessible the omics data generated within the teams and platforms of the Université Côte d’Azur institutes of biology. In addition, it will allow non-bioinformatician users to reproduce common analyzes in a simple and reproducible manner on hosted data.

<br><br>

Such a tool would be an important direct application to the EquipEx+ 4D-OMICS project, the objective of which is to provide computer resources to decipher the fundamental mechanisms that govern living organisms. 4D-OMICS takes into account new technological advances in biology which produce massive multidimensional data, from which biologists seek to decipher dynamic biological processes (cellular biology, developmental biology, evolution), multivariate (affecting molecules, physicochemical parameters) and multi-scale (ranging from molecules to ecosystems, from milliseconds to millions of years). The 4D-OMICS project must set up a coherent regional digital resource, between Université Côte d'Azur and Aix Marseille University, with the partnerships of Eurecom, APHM and IPC.

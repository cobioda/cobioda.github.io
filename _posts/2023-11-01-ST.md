## Evolution of spatial transcriptomics

The field has quickly expanded in recent years, and several new technologies have been developed that all aim to combine gene expression data with spatial information. The vast array of methodologies displays fundamental differences in their approach to obtain this information, and thus, demonstrate method-specific advantages and shortcomings.

In the last 5 years most of the spatial transcriptomics paper have utilized in-situ capture methods such as the Visium assay (10x Genomics). Based on oligo-dT barcodes primers of 55µm diameter, the signal is basically obtained from 5 to 15 cells under each spots. The polyA capture renders the Visium assay whole transcriptome. Since 2 years the field is rapidly evolving towards the recovery of the single-cell resolution and even better the sub-cellular resolution thanks to imaging-based acquisition. Those assays are limited to a restricted number of gene targets that could be image, typically between 300 and 1000.

## Technologies

Single-molecule spatial imaging-based transcriptomics via multiplexed RNA fluorescent hybridization can reveal detailed tissue organization at the single-cell resolution. Currently 3 platforms are accessible to the academics community : CosmX (nanostring), Merscope (Vizgen) and Xenium (10x Genomics). Those 3 platforms utilizes different efficient chemistries to revealed the sub-cellular localization of transcripts molecules.

At IPMC we choose in october 2022 to acquire the Merscope system (Vizgen) and plan an upgrade in march 2024 with the acquisition of the Xenium (10x Genomics) that shows higher performances compared to the merscope in FFPE tissue slices. We envision to perform fresh frozen sample using the Merscope and FFPE sample with the Xenium system in 2024.

## Planning a Merscope/Xenium spatial transcriptomics experiment

### Defining the gene target panel

One of the critical task that require a careful attention is the selection of the target gene panel that will be imaged during the chemistry. This target gene panel needs to integrate genes that will have different mission during statistical analysis that will be performed by bioinformaticians after acquisition on the system: (i) first you will need genes for the cell typing process (assign a cell type) for all cells that might be on your slices, thanks to global initiative such as the Human Cell Atlas, a lot of single-cell resources exist today to compose this list; (ii) second, you will integrate genes that are part of pathways that you want to explore in your system; (iii) you might want to integrate genes that acts as ligand-receptor pairs in your systems.
Note that compagnies provide several pre-designed panels related to the global aim of your study objective (Cancer panel, brain panel, )

Note that the Xenium platform allows to complement pre-designed panels with custom gene panels (50 or 100 custom gene).

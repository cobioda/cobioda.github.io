## Evolution of spatial transcriptomics

The field has quickly expanded in recent years, and several new technologies have been developed that all aim to combine gene expression data with spatial information. The vast array of methodologies displays fundamental differences in their approach to obtain this information, and thus, demonstrate method-specific advantages and shortcomings.

In the last 5 years most of the spatial transcriptomics paper have utilized in-situ capture methods such as the Visium assay (10x Genomics). Based on oligo-dT barcodes primers of 55µm diameter, the

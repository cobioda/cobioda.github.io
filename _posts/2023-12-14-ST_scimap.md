* [scimap](https://scimap.xyz/ "scimap") is a scalable toolkit for analyzing spatial molecular data. The underlying framework is generalizable to spatial datasets mapped to XY coordinates. The package uses the anndata framework making it easy to integrate with other popular single-cell analysis toolkits. It includes preprocessing, phenotyping, visualization, clustering, spatial analysis and differential spatial testing. The Python-based implementation efficiently deals with large datasets of millions of cells.

* [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ "scanpy") is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data built jointly with anndata. It includes preprocessing, visualization, clustering, trajectory inference and differential expression testing. The Python-based implementation efficiently deals with datasets of more than one million cells.
<br>

* [anndata](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "anndata") is a Python package for handling annotated data matrices in memory and on disk, positioned between pandas and xarray. anndata offers a broad range of computationally efficient features including, among others, sparse data support, lazy operations, and a PyTorch interface.

## Import required package in a python notebook

```python
import scimap as sm
import scanpy as sc
import pandas as pd
import anndata as ad
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

## Read a spatial experiment object as Anndata object

You might refers to previous blog posts on spatial transcriptomics data analysis to produce such a .h5ad anndata file that contains the analysis of a spatial transcriptomics experiment.

```python
P14r1 = sc.read_h5ad('adP14r1.h5ad')
```

## Use scimap to visualize cells within the UMAP and it's real spatial position into the tissue slice

```python
sm.hl.animate (P14r1, color='celltype', embedding='X_umap',
               x_coordinate='center_x', y_coordinate='center_y',n_frames=150, interval=150, final_frame=50, title='P14 region 1', alpha=1,
               plot_legend=True, fontsize=8, s=1, pltStyle='dark_background', figsize=(10, 8), watermark=False,
               palette=palette,
               save_animation="p14r1.gif")
```

The volume of data from experiments in biology is constantly increasing. The storage, access and use of this highly heterogeneous multiomics data is essential to allow the success of large-scale scientific projects in biology. Many of the institute's research teams and technical platforms are in short supply of bioinformatics resources for the analysis of their generated data, whether in genomics, proteomics, cytometry or imaging. Today, the analysis of these different types of data is mainly treated independently, platform by platform, project by project, team by team without structuring the resources and bioinformatics skills required and without transversal integration of the different datasets produced by the technical core facilities.

The main aim of CoBiODA is to define the bases for the establishment of a bioinformatics platform from the angle of a research support centre for the IPMC teams aiming to allow an emulation of the bioinformatics resources within a common structure. Such a structure will represent a possibility for developing strong interactions between bioinformaticians, gathering the team bioinformatics efforts and will facilitated transversal integration of heterogeneous data sets produced by the different technical platforms. Research teams could thus benefit from the high-performance bioinformatics support necessary for the production of high-impact publications enhancing the work of the institute's researchers and engineers.
